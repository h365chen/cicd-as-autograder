# Setup Student Repos

Forking the `ece100/root/a0/starter` repo seems to be the most convenient way to
create student repos. However, this step cannot be trivially done through
`glab`. Although `glab` supports to fork a repo using the command line, it does
not allow us to control which target group the repo will be forked into. It
always assumes you fork the repo into your personal namespace.

Therefore, either we ask students to manually fork the `starter` repo using the
web interface, or we copy the `starter` repo into `stu-00` locally, then push
the repo into the target group, i.e., `ece100/term-00/a0/stu-00`.

There are many tools available for achieving it. I will demonstrate one of them
to achieve it.
