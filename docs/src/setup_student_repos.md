# Setup Student Repos

Forking the `ece100/root/a0/starter` repository is likely the most convenient
way to create student repositories. However, this step cannot be easily
performed through `glab`. Although `glab` supports forking a repository via the
command line, it does not allow control over the target group. That said, the
repository is always forked into your personal namespace by default.

Therefore, we have two options:

1. Ask students to manually fork the `starter` repository using the GitLab web
   interface.
2. Copy the contents of the `starter` repository into a local folder (e.g.,
   `stu-00`), and then push it to the desired target group, such as
   `ece100/term-00/a0/stu-00`.

There are many tools available to automate this process. I will demonstrate one
approach to achieve it.
